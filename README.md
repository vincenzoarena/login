### About Project

My first attempt to create a copy of a login page using HTML and CSS.

### How to use this Project

This is a login page that can be almost used as a real one. The buttons on the left lead to social media platforms, but there is no connection to them to login into any real website. Is it possible to enter an e-mail address and a password to log in, and to flag the "Remember me" field, but no real login to any service will be done and no data will be collected in any database.
